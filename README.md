Modern Web Development Demos
===========

Welcome to our demos repository for 
[Modern Web Development Course](https://www.develop.com/training-course/modern-web-development-with-html5-mvc-web-api-angularjs-javascript-and-bootstrap) 
from [DevelopMentor](https://develop.com). 

If you are in one of our courses *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took the course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course probably lives **in another branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it or just contact us (requests@develop.com).

If you are **not** in one of our courses, enjoy the samples and please consider DevelopMentor for your [Web Training](https://www.develop.com/training-courses/web)!
